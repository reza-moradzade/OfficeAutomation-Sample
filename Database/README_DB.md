# Office Automation Database (Final Version)

This repository contains the **SQL Server database schema** for a **scalable, secure, hybrid Office Automation System**.  
Designed to support **20,000+ registered users** and **10,000+ concurrent sessions**, with a strong focus on **security, auditability, and performance**.

---

## üìÇ Database Features

### 1. User Management
- **Users Table** with `PasswordHash + Salt` for secure authentication.
- **UserRoles** and **Roles** for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- `RowVersion` column for **optimistic concurrency**.
- `IsDeleted` column for **soft deletes** (records are never physically deleted).
- `IsEmailConfirmed` column for email verification status.

### 2. Authentication & Sessions
- **UserSessions** table tracks sessions with:
  - `SessionToken`, `ClientType` (Web / Windows / Mobile)
  - `LastActivity` timestamp for inactivity detection
  - Enforced **single active session per client type**
- **RefreshTokens** table for secure token-based authentication with revocation tracking
- `RowVersion` ensures concurrency safety.

### 3. Audit & Logging
- **AuditLogs** table stores all user activity.
- **FailedLoginAttempts** tracks and prevents brute-force attacks.
- **Archiving**:
  - `AuditLogs_Archive` stores old logs for long-term retention.
- Indexed for reporting and monitoring.

### 4. Task Management
- **Tasks Table** supports:
  - `Status`, `AssignedTo`, `DueDate`, `RowVersion`, `IsDeleted`
- **Cartable Table** stores user-specific task assignments (inbox)
  - Tracks `IsRead` and `ReceivedAt` timestamp
- Enables safe multi-user task handling without conflicts.
- **Files Table** linked to tasks supports attachments:
  - `FileName`, `ContentType`, `FileSize`, optional `FileContent`
  - Recommendation: store large files externally (S3, Azure Blob, MinIO)

### 5. Security Enhancements
- Passwords hashed and salted (recommend bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2)
- Session tokens use GUIDs and validated via `RowVersion`
- CaptchaAttempts table for login/signup bot prevention
- EmailVerifications table for account confirmation
- Only parameterized queries allowed in API to prevent SQL Injection
- Audit trail ensures full accountability

### 6. Performance & Scalability
- Indexed for fast login, session monitoring, and audit reporting:
  - `IX_Users_UserName_Active`
  - `IX_UserSessions_LastActivity`
  - `IX_AuditLogs_Timestamp`
  - `IX_Tasks_AssignedTo_Status`
  - `IX_Cartable_UserId_IsRead_ReceivedAt`
- Designed to handle **10,000+ concurrent sessions**
- Use caching (Redis) and external storage for large files when scaling horizontally

### 7. Monitoring & Maintenance
- `LastActivity` in `UserSessions` can detect idle sessions
- Track system stats (peak concurrent users, average session duration, failed logins) with optional `SystemStats` table
- Archive old audit logs to reduce table size

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps
1. Execute `OfficeAutomationDB_Final.sql` in **SQL Server Management Studio**.
2. Configure connection string in **Web, WinForms, or Mobile application**.
3. Implement security best practices:
   - Least-privilege accounts
   - TLS/HTTPS for application access
   - Row-level security for multi-department environments (optional)

---

## üìå Best Practices
- Store large files outside the DB (filesystem or object storage)  
- Enable **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** for sensitive environments  
- Use **Redis** or similar caching for high concurrency session management  
- Regularly monitor `FailedLoginAttempts`, `AuditLogs`, and `CaptchaAttempts` for security incidents  
- Ensure `RowVersion` is always used in update operations to prevent concurrency conflicts  
- Validate `EmailVerifications` tokens and handle expiration correctly

This database is **ready for hybrid deployment** (Blazor Web + WinForms + API backend) and **optimized for high concurrency** while maintaining strong security and audit compliance.
